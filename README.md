This game is an action stealth game where the player plays as a cyborg. The player can run around and jump on top of various obstacles. The objective of the game is to kill all the enemies on the map without being spotted. Enemies will have a straightforward walking pattern and the player will have to avoid their vision and attack them from behind with their sword. Players will use cover, high ground, and their fast movement speed to avoid detection. If the player is spotted, the nearby enemies will shoot at them until they can no longer see the player.
